Developed a social platform using We-chat mini-program where users can post book reviews, rate movies and search for
movie information.

 - JavaScript language is used to implement the logic layer structure. This includes the handling of user operations, system
API calls, etc.

 - Create a new Web View in advance to prepare for new page rendering and use https to ensure security during
transmission. Separate View and logic layers, not directly manipulating the DOM through data-driven, increase the
efficiency.

 - Use JSON technology to represent the configuration information of the application. Contains basic information about the
application, page configuration and routing, application-wide information, etc.
